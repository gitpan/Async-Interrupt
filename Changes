Revision history for Perl extension Async::Interrupt.

0.6   Sat Jul 18 07:09:33 CEST 2009
	- add autodrain setting.
        - added Async::Interrupt::EventPipe class.
        - fixed a potential race issue by removing the internal
          epipe state.
        - destroying asyncs inside their handler callback could lead
          to segfaults.
        - destoying an interrupt object did not properly remove it
          from the asyncs list (classical case of side-effect-inside-assert).

0.501 Fri Jul 17 16:58:51 CEST 2009
	- do no longer errornously do operations on fd 0 if no pipe
          is associated with the interrupt object.

0.5   Fri Jul 17 03:53:21 CEST 2009
	- INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: signalling the value 0 is no longer allowed.
	- added automatic pipe creation code, including post_fork method.
        - added ->c_var method, and the ability to use a perl scalar as
          signal checker.

0.042 Tue Jul 14 21:51:04 CEST 2009
	- enforce initialisation of perl's signal handling framework,
          avoiding crashes otherwise.

        - freely sprinkle around more volatiles.
        - fix initialisation code (XSLoader).
        - ported to win32.
